Online-Cafe
This project is designed to help working professionals and students who cannot afford to visit common service centers and wait in long queues for form-filling and document-related services. Traditionally, people visit offline centers to fill out important forms, such as applications for competitive exams like JEE and UPSC. They also rely on these centers for applying for essential documents like Aadhaar Card, PAN Card, Driving License, etc., which might be difficult for them to complete on their own.

To streamline this process, we have created an efficient online alternative. Our website allows users to sign up with their credentials and connect with available (online) authors via a real-time chat system built by us. The user can send the necessary documents to the author for form submission. The author will then share a preview of the filled form, and upon payment through our secure and reliable payment gateway, the form will be officially submitted. Once the process is complete, the documents will be deleted from the author's side for security purposes.

To ensure authenticity, we store the essential details of the authors, including their address, Aadhaar number, and contact information, in our database.

After the process is completed, the user will have access to a feedback page, where they can rate the experience from 1 to 5 stars.

This platform aims to provide a hassle-free, efficient, and secure solution for those who require online assistance with form-filling and document-related services
